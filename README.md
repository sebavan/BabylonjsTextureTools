## Running locally

After cloning the repo, running locally during development is all the simplest:
```
npm install
npm start
```

For VSCode users, if you have installed the Chrome Debugging extension, you can start debugging within VSCode by using the appropriate launch menu.

## Special thanks
To Filament and its team for the code and support :-)
